# Introduction to `R`  {#R-intro}

## Getting Started

`R` is both a programming language and software environment for statistical computing, which is *free* and *open-source*. To get started, you will need to install two pieces of software:

- [`R`, the actual programming language.](https://www.r-project.org)
    - Chose your operating system, and select the most recent version, `r paste0(version$major, "." ,version$minor)`.
- [RStudio, an excellent IDE for working with `R`.](http://www.rstudio.com/)
    - Note, you must have `R` installed to use RStudio. RStudio is simply an interface used to interact with `R`.

The popularity of `R` is on the rise, and everyday it becomes a better tool for statistical analysis. It even generated this book! (A skill you will learn in this course.) There are many good resources for learning `R`. 

The following few chapters will serve as a whirlwind introduction to `R`. They are by no means meant to be a complete reference for the `R` language, but simply an introduction to the basics that we will need along the way. Several of the more important topics will be re-stressed as they are actually needed for analyses.

This introductory `R` chapter may feel like an overwhelming amount of information. You are not expected to pick up everything the first time through. You should try all of the code from this chapter, then return to it a number of times as you return to the concepts when performing analyses. We present the bare basics in this chapter, some more details are in chapter \@ref(R-advanced).

RStudio has a large number of useful keyboard shortcuts. A list of these can be found using a keyboard shortcut -- the keyboard shortcut to rule them all:

- On Windows: `Alt` + `Shift` + `K`
- On Mac:  `Option` + `Shift` + `K`

The RStudio team has developed [a number of "cheatsheets"](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) for working with both `R` and RStudio. [This particular cheatseet for Base `R`](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/base-r.pdf) will summarize many of the concepts in this document.

When programming, it is often a good practice to follow a style guide. (Where do spaces go? Tabs or spaces? Underscores or CamelCase when naming variables?) No style guide is "correct" but it helps to be aware of what others do. The more import thing is to be consistent within your own code.

- [Hadley Wickham Style Guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) from [Advanced `R`](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)
- [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml)

For this course, our main deviation from these two guides is the use of `=` in place of `<-`. For all practical purposes, you should think `=` whenever you see `<-`.

## Basic Calculations

To get started, we'll use `R` like a simple calculator.

#### Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division {-}

| Math          | `R`     | Result    |
|:-------------:|:-------:|:---------:|
| $3 + 2$       | `3 + 2` | `r 3 + 2` |
| $3 - 2$       | `3 - 2` | `r 3 - 2` |
| $3 \cdot2$    | `3 * 2` | `r 3 * 2` |
| $3 / 2$       | `3 / 2` | `r 3 / 2` |

#### Exponents  {-}

| Math         | `R`             | Result            |
|:-------------:|:-------:|:---------:|
| $3^2$        | `3 ^ 2`         | `r 3 ^ 2`         |
| $2^{(-3)}$   | `2 ^ (-3)`      | `r 2 ^ (-3)`      |
| $100^{1/2}$  | `100 ^ (1 / 2)` | `r 100 ^ (1 / 2)` |
| $\sqrt{100}$ | `sqrt(100)`     | `r sqrt(100)`     |


#### Mathematical Constants  {-}

| Math         | `R`             | Result            |
|:------------:|:---------------:|:-----------------:|
| $\pi$        | `pi`            | `r pi`            |
| $e$          | `exp(1)`        | `r exp(1)`        |

#### Logarithms  {-}

Note that we will use $\ln$ and $\log$ interchangeably to mean the natural logarithm. There is no `ln()` in `R`, instead it uses `log()` to mean the natural logarithm.

| Math              | `R`                 | Result                |
|:------------:|:---------------:|:-----------------:|

| $\log_{10}(1000)$ | `log10(1000)`       | `r log10(1000)`       |
| $\log_{2}(8)$     | `log2(8)`           | `r log2(8)`           |
| $\log_{4}(16)$    | `log(16, base = 4)` | `r log(16, base = 4)` |

#### Trigonometry  {-}

| Math            | `R`           | Result          |
|:------------:|:---------------:|:-----------------:|
| $\sin(\pi / 2)$ | `sin(pi / 2)` | `r sin(pi / 2)` |
| $\cos(0)$       | `cos(0)`      | `r cos(0)`      |

## Getting Help

In using `R` as a calculator, we have seen a number of functions: `sqrt()`, `exp()`, `log()` and `sin()`. To get documentation about a function in `R`, simply put a question mark in front of the function name, or call the function `help(function)` and RStudio will display the documentation, for example: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?log
?sin
?paste
?lm
help(lm)   # help() is equivalent
help(ggplot,package="ggplot2")  # show help from a certain package
```

Frequently one of the most difficult things to do when learning `R` is asking for help. First, you need to decide to ask for help, then you need to know *how* to ask for help. Your very first line of defense should be to Google your error message or a short description of your issue. (The ability to solve problems using this method is quickly becoming an extremely valuable skill.) If that fails, and it eventually will, you should ask for help. There are a number of things you should include when emailing an instructor, or posting to a help website such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com).

- Describe what you expect the code to do.
- State the end goal you are trying to achieve. (Sometimes what you expect the code to do, is not what you want to actually do.)
- Provide the full text of any errors you have received.
- Provide enough code to recreate the error. Often for the purpose of this course, you could simply post your entire `.R` or `.Rmd` to `slack`.
- Sometimes it is also helpful to include a screenshot of your entire RStudio window when the error occurs.

If you follow these steps, you will get your issue resolved much quicker, and possibly learn more in the process. Do not be discouraged by running into errors and difficulties when learning `R`. (Or any other technical skill.) It is simply part of the learning process.

## Installing Packages

`R` comes with a number of built-in functions and datasets, but one of the main strengths of `R` as an open-source project is its package system. Packages add additional functions and data. Frequently if you want to do something in `R`, and it is not available by default, there is a good chance that there is a package that will fulfill your needs.

To install a package, use the `install.packages()` function. Think of this as buying a recipe book from the store, bringing it home, and putting it on your shelf (i.e. into your library):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

Once a package is installed, it must be loaded into your current `R` session before being used. Think of this as taking the book off of the shelf and opening it up to read.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

Once you close `R`, all the packages are closed and put back on the imaginary shelf. The next time you open `R`, you do not have to install the package again, but you do have to load any packages you intend to use by invoking `library()`.

## Data Types {#data-types}

`R` has a number of basic *data types*. While `R` is not a *strongly typed language* (i.e. you can be agnostic about types most of the times), it is useful to know what data types are available to you:

- Numeric
    - Also known as Double. The default type when dealing with numbers.
    - Examples: `1`, `1.0`, `42.5`
- Integer
    - Examples: `1L`, `2L`, `42L`
- Complex
    - Example: `4 + 2i`
- Logical
    - Two possible values: `TRUE` and `FALSE`
    - You can also use `T` and `F`, but this is *not* recommended.
    - `NA` is also considered logical.
- Character
    - Examples: `"a"`, `"Statistics"`, `"1 plus 2."`
- Categorical or `factor`
    - A mixture of integer and character. A `factor` variable assigns a label to a numeric value.
    - For example `factor(x=c(0,1),labels=c("male","female"))` assigns the string *male* to the numeric values `0`, and the string *female* to the value `1`. 

## Data Structures

`R` also has a number of basic data *structures*. A data structure is either homogeneous (all elements are of the same data type) or heterogeneous (elements can be of more than one data type).

| Dimension | **Homogeneous** | **Heterogeneous** |
|:---------:|:---------------:|:-----------------:|
| 1         | Vector          | List              |
| 2         | Matrix          | Data Frame        |
| 3+        | Array           |    nested Lists               |

### Vectors

Many operations in `R` make heavy use of **vectors**. Vectors in `R` are indexed starting at `1`. That is what the `[1]` in the output is indicating, that the first element of the row being displayed is the first element of the vector. Larger vectors will start additional rows with something like `[7]` where `7` is the index of the first element of that row.

Possibly the most common way to create a vector in `R` is using the `c()` function, which is short for "combine". As the name suggests, it combines a list of elements separated by commas. [you should type all of those examples into your `R` console!!]

```{r}
c(1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9)
```

Here `R` simply outputs this vector. If we would like to store this vector in a **variable** we can do so with the **assignment** operator `=`. In this case the variable `x` now holds the vector we just created, and we can access the vector by typing `x`.

```{r}
x = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9)
x
```

As an aside, there is a long history of the assignment operator in `R`, partially due to the keys available on the [keyboards of the creators of the `S` language.](https://twitter.com/kwbroman/status/747829864091127809) (Which preceded `R`.) For simplicity we will use `=`, but know that often you will see `<-` as the assignment operator. 

Because vectors must contain elements that are all the same type, `R` will automatically **coerce** (i.e. convert) to a single type when attempting to create a vector that combines multiple types.

```{r}
c(42, "Statistics", TRUE)
c(42, TRUE)
```

Frequently you may wish to create a vector based on a sequence of numbers. The quickest and easiest way to do this is with the `:` operator, which creates a sequence of integers between two specified integers.

```{r}
(y = 1:100)
```

Here we see `R` labeling the rows after the first since this is a large vector. Also, we see that by putting parentheses around the assignment, `R` both stores the vector in a variable called `y` and automatically outputs `y` to the console.

Note that scalars do not exists in `R`. They are simply vectors of length `1`.

```{r}
2
```

If we want to create a sequence that isn't limited to integers and increasing by 1 at a time, we can use the `seq()` function.

```{r}
seq(from = 1.5, to = 4.2, by = 0.1)
```

We will discuss functions in detail later, but note here that the input labels `from`, `to`, and `by` are optional.

```{r}
seq(1.5, 4.2, 0.1)
```

Another common operation to create a vector is `rep()`, which can repeat a single value a number of times.

```{r}
rep("A", times = 10)
```

The `rep()` function can be used to repeat a vector some number of times.

```{r}
rep(x, times = 3)
```

We have now seen four different ways to create vectors:

- `c()`
- `:`
- `seq()`
- `rep()`

So far we have mostly used them in isolation, but they are often used together.

```{r}
c(x, rep(seq(1, 9, 2), 3), c(1, 2, 3), 42, 2:4)
```

The length of a vector can be obtained with the `length()` function.

```{r}
length(x)
length(y)
```

#### Task 1

Let's try this out!

1. Create a vector of five ones, i.e. `[1,1,1,1,1]`
1. Notice that the colon operator `a:b` is just short for *construct a sequence **from** `a` **to** `b`*. Create a vector the counts down from 10 to 0, i.e. it looks like `10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0`!
1. the `rep` function takes additional arguments `times` (as above), and `each`, which tells you how often *each element* should be repeated (as opposed to the entire input vector). Use `rep` to create a vector that looks like this: `1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3`

#### Subsetting

To subset a vector, i.e. to choose only some elements of it, we use square brackets, `[]`. 

```{r}
x
x[1]
x[3]
```

We see that `x[1]` returns the first element, and `x[3]` returns the third element.

```{r}
x[-2]
```

We can also exclude certain indexes, in this case the second element. 

```{r}
x[1:3]
x[c(1,3,4)]
```

Lastly we see that we can subset based on a vector of indices.

All of the above are subsetting a vector using a vector of indexes. (Remember a single number is still a vector.) We could instead use a vector of logical values.

```{r}
z = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
z
```

```{r}
x[z]
```

### Vectorization

One of the biggest strengths of `R` is its use of vectorized operations. This means, operations which work on - and are optimized for - entire vectors.

```{r}
x = 1:10  # a vector
x + 1     # add scalar
2 * x     # multiply all elts by 2
2 ^ x     # take 2 to the x as exponents
sqrt(x)   # compute the square root of all elements in x
log(x)
```

We see that when a function like `log()` is called on a vector `x`, a vector is returned which has applied the function to each element of the vector  `x`.


### Logical Operators

| Operator | Summary               | Example               | Result |
|:---------|:---------------------:|:---------------------:|:-------:|
| `x < y`  | `x` less than `y`                | `3 < 42`               | `r 3 < 42`               |
| `x > y`  | `x` greater than `y`             | `3 > 42`               | `r 3 > 42`               |
| `x <= y` | `x` less than or equal to `y`    | `3 <= 42`              | `r 3 <= 42`              |
| `x >= y` | `x` greater than or equal to `y` | `3 >= 42`              | `r 3 >= 42`              |
| `x == y` | `x`equal to `y`                  | `3 == 42`              | `r 3 == 42`              |
| `x != y` | `x` not equal to `y`             | `3 != 42`              | `r 3 != 42`              |
| `!x`     | not `x`                          | `!(3 > 42)`            | `r !(3 > 42)`            |
| `x | y`  | `x` or `y`                       | `(3 > 42) | TRUE`      | `r (3 > 42) | TRUE`      |
| `x & y`  | `x` and `y`                      | `(3 < 4) & ( 42 > 13)` | `r (3 < 4) & ( 42 > 13)` |

In `R`, logical operators are vectorized. 

```{r}
x = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9)
```

```{r}
x > 3
x < 3
x == 3
x != 3
```

```{r}
x == 3 & x != 3
x == 3 | x != 3
```

This is extremely useful for subsetting.

```{r}
x[x > 3]
x[x != 3]
```


```{r}
sum(x > 3)
as.numeric(x > 3)
```

Here we see that using the `sum()` function on a vector of logical `TRUE` and `FALSE` values that is the result of `x > 3` results in a numeric result. `R` is first automatically coercing the logical to numeric where `TRUE` is `1` and `FALSE` is `0`. This coercion from logical to numeric happens for most mathematical operations.

```{r}
# which(condition of x) returns true/false  
# each index of x where condition is true
which(x > 3)
x[which(x > 3)]

max(x)
which(x == max(x))
which.max(x)
```

#### Task 2

1. Create a vector filled with 10 numbers drawn from the uniform distribution (hint: use function `runif`) and store them in `x`.
1. Using logical subsetting as above, get all the elements of `x` which are larger than 0.5, and store them in `y`. 
1. using the function `which`, store the *indices* of all the elements of `x` which are larger than 0.5 in `iy`. 
1. Check that `y` and `x[iy]` are identical. 

### Matrices

`R` can also be used for **matrix** calculations. Matrices have rows and columns containing a single data type. In a matrix, the order of rows and columns is important. (This is not true of *data frames*, which we will see later.)

Matrices can be created using the `matrix` function. 

```{r}
x = 1:9
x
X = matrix(x, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
X
```

Notice here that `R` is case sensitive (`x` vs `X`).

By default the `matrix` function fills your data into the matrix column by column. But we can also tell `R` to fill rows instead:

```{r}
Y = matrix(x, nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
Y
```

We can also create a matrix of a specified dimension where every element is the same, in this case `0`.

```{r}
Z = matrix(0, 2, 4)
Z
```

Like vectors, matrices can be subsetted using square brackets, `[]`. However, since matrices are two-dimensional, we need to specify both a row and a column when subsetting.

```{r}
X
X[1, 2]
```

Here we accessed the element in the first row and the second column. We could also subset an entire row or column.

```{r}
X[1, ]
X[, 2]
```

We can also use vectors to subset more than one row or column at a time. Here we subset to the first and third column of the second row.

```{r}
X[2, c(1, 3)]
```

Matrices can also be created by combining vectors as columns, using `cbind`, or combining vectors as rows, using `rbind`.

```{r}
x = 1:9
rev(x)
rep(1, 9)
```

```{r}
rbind(x, rev(x), rep(1, 9))
```

```{r}
cbind(col_1 = x, col_2 = rev(x), col_3 = rep(1, 9))
```

When using `rbind` and `cbind` you can specify "argument" names that will be used as column names.

`R` can then be used to perform matrix calculations.

```{r}
x = 1:9
y = 9:1
X = matrix(x, 3, 3)
Y = matrix(y, 3, 3)
X
Y
```

```{r}
X + Y
X - Y
X * Y
X / Y
```

Note that `X * Y` is **not** matrix multiplication. It is *element by element* multiplication. (Same for `X / Y`). 
Matrix multiplication uses `%*%`. Other matrix functions include `t()` which gives the transpose of a matrix and `solve()` which returns the inverse of a square matrix if it is invertible.

```{r}
X %*% Y
t(X)
```

### Arrays

A vector is a one-dimensional array. A matrix is a two-dimensional array. In `R` you can create arrays of arbitrary dimensionality `N`. Here is how:

```{r}
d = 1:16
d3 = array(data = d,dim = c(4,2,2))
d4 = array(data = d,dim = c(4,2,2,3))  # will recycle 1:16
d3
```

You can see that `d3` are simply *two* (4,2) matrices laid on top of each other, as if there were *two pages*. Similary, `d4` would have two pages, and another 3 registers in a fourth dimension. And so on.
You can subset an array like you would a vector or a matrix, taking care to index each dimension:

```{r}
d3[ ,1,1]  # all elements from col 1, page 1
d3[2:3, , ]  # rows 2:3 from all pages
d3[2,2, ]  # row 2, col 2 from both pages.
```


#### Task 3

1. Create a vector containing `1,2,3,4,5` called v. 
1. Create a (2,5) matrix `m` containing the data `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10`. The first row should be `1,2,3,4,5`.
1. Perform matrix multiplication of `m` with `v`. Use the command `%*%`. What dimension does the output have?
1. Why does `v %*% m` not work? 


### Lists

A list is a one-dimensional *heterogeneous* data structure. So it is indexed like a vector with a single integer value (or with a name), but each element can contain an element of any type. Lists are similar to a python or julia `Dict` object. Many `R` structures and outputs are lists themselves. Lists are extremely useful and versatile objects, so make sure you understand their useage:

```{r}
# creation without fieldnames
list(42, "Hello", TRUE)

# creation with fieldnames
ex_list = list(
  a = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
  b = TRUE,
  c = "Hello!",
  d = function(arg = 42) {print("Hello World!")},
  e = diag(5)
)
```

Lists can be subset using two syntaxes, the `$` operator, and square brackets `[]`. The `$` operator returns a named **element** of a list. The `[]` syntax returns a **list**, while the `[[]]` returns an **element** of a list.

- `ex_list[1]` returns a list contain the first element.
- `ex_list[[1]]` returns the first element of the list, in this case, a vector.

```{r}
# subsetting
ex_list$e

ex_list[1:2]
ex_list[1]
ex_list[[1]]
ex_list[c("e", "a")]
ex_list["e"]
ex_list[["e"]]

ex_list$d
ex_list$d(arg = 1)
```

#### Task 4

1. Copy and paste the above code for `ex_list` into your R session. Remember that `list` can hold any kind of `R` object. Like...another list! So, create a new list `new_list` that has two fields: a first field called "this" with string content `"is awesome"`, and a second field called "ex_list" that contains `ex_list`. 
1. Accessing members is like in a plain list, just with several layers now. Get the element `c` from `ex_list` in `new_list`!
1. Compose a new string out of the first element in `new_list`, the element under label `this`. Use the function `paste` to print `R is awesome` to your screen.

### Data Frames {#dataframes}

We have previously seen vectors and matrices for storing data as we introduced `R`. We will now introduce a **data frame** which will be the most common way that we store and interact with data in this course. A `data.frame` is similar to a python `pandas.dataframe` or a julia `DataFrame`. (But the `R` version was the first! :-) )

```{r}
example_data = data.frame(x = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9),
                          y = c(rep("Hello", 9), "Goodbye"),
                          z = rep(c(TRUE, FALSE), 5))
```

Unlike a matrix, which can be thought of as a vector rearranged into rows and columns, a data frame is not required to have the same data type for each element. A data frame is a **list** of vectors, and each vector has a *name*. So, each vector must contain the same data type, but the different vectors can store different data types. Note, however, that all vectors must have **the same length** (differently from a `list`)!

```{r}
example_data
```

Unlike a list which has more flexibility, the elements of a data frame must all be vectors. Again, we access any given column with the `$` operator:

```{r}
example_data$x

all.equal(length(example_data$x),
          length(example_data$y),
          length(example_data$z))

str(example_data)

nrow(example_data)
ncol(example_data)
dim(example_data)
names(example_data)
```

The `data.frame()` function above is one way to create a data frame. We can also import data from various file types in into `R`, as well as use data stored in packages.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
write.csv(example_data, "data/example-data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
write.csv(example_data,"inst/datasets/example-data.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```

To read this data into `R`, we would use the `read_csv()` function from the `readr` package. Note that `R` has a built in function `read.csv()` that operates very similarly. The `readr` function `read_csv()` has a number of advantages. For example, it is much faster reading larger data. [It also uses the `tibble` package to read the data as a tibble.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tibble/vignettes/tibble.html) A `tibble` is simply a data frame that prints with sanity. Notice in the output below that we are given additional information such as dimension and variable type.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(readr)  # you need `install.packages("readr")` once!
path = system.file(package="ScPoEconometrics","datasets","example-data.csv")
example_data_from_disk = read_csv(path)
```

This particular line of code assumes that you installed the associated R package to this book, hence you have this dataset stored on your computer at `system.file(package = "ScPoEconometrics","datasets","example-data.csv")`. 

```{r}
example_data_from_disk
```



The `as_tibble()` function can be used to coerce a regular data frame to a tibble.

```{r}
library(tibble)
example_data = as_tibble(example_data)
example_data
```

Alternatively, we could use the "Import Dataset" feature in RStudio which can be found in the environment window. (By default, the top-right pane of RStudio.)  Once completed, this process will automatically generate the code to import a file. The resulting code will be shown in the console window. In recent versions of RStudio, `read_csv()` is used by default, thus reading in a tibble.

Earlier we looked at installing packages, in particular the `ggplot2` package. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

Inside the `ggplot2` package is a dataset called `mpg`. By loading the package using the `library()` function, we can now access `mpg`.

When using data from inside a package, there are three things we would generally like to do:

- Look at the raw data.
- Understand the data. (Where did it come from? What are the variables? Etc.)
- Visualize the data.

To look at the data, we have two useful commands: `head()` and `str()`.

```{r}
data(mpg)  # load dataset `mpg` from `ggplot2` package
head(mpg, n = 10)
```

The function `head()` will display the first `n` observations of the data frame. The `head()` function was more useful before tibbles. Notice that `mpg` is a tibble already, so the output from `head()` indicates there are only `10` observations. Note that this applies to `head(mpg, n = 10)` and not `mpg` itself. Also note that tibbles print a limited number of rows and columns by default. The last line of the printed output indicates with rows and columns were omitted.

```{r}
mpg
```

The function `str()` will display the "structure" of the data frame. It will display the number of **observations** and **variables**, list the variables, give the type of each variable, and show some elements of each variable. This information can also be found in the "Environment" window in RStudio.

```{r}
str(mpg)
```

In this dataset an observation is for a particular model-year of a car, and the variables describe attributes of the car, for example its highway fuel efficiency.

To understand more about the data set, we use the `?` operator to pull up the documentation for the data.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?mpg
```

`R` has a number of functions for quickly working with and extracting basic information from data frames. To quickly obtain a vector of the variable names, we use the `names()` function.

```{r}
names(mpg)
```

To access one of the variables **as a vector**, we use the `$` operator.

```{r}
mpg$year
mpg$hwy
```

We can use the `dim()`, `nrow()` and `ncol()` functions to obtain information about the dimension of the data frame.

```{r}
dim(mpg)
nrow(mpg)
ncol(mpg)
```

Here `nrow()` is also the number of observations, which in most cases is the *sample size*.

Subsetting data frames can work much like subsetting matrices using square brackets, `[ , ]`. Here, we find fuel efficient vehicles earning over 35 miles per gallon and only display `manufacturer`, `model` and `year`.

```{r}
# mpg[row condition, col condition]
mpg[mpg$hwy > 35, c("manufacturer", "model", "year")]
```

An alternative would be to use the `subset()` function, which has a much more readable syntax.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
subset(mpg, subset = hwy > 35, select = c("manufacturer", "model", "year"))
```

Lastly, we could use the `filter` and `select` functions from the `dplyr` package which introduces the *pipe operator* `%>%` from the `magrittr` package. A *pipe* is a concept from the Unix world, where it means to take the output of some command, and pass it on to another command. This way, one can construct a *pipeline* of commands. We will see more of this in chapter \@ref(sum). For additional info on the pipe operator in R, you might be interested [in this tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pipe-r-tutorial).

```{r, eval = TRUE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
mpg %>% 
  filter(hwy > 35) %>% 
  select(manufacturer, model, year)
```

All three approaches produce the same results. Which you use will be largely based on a given situation as well as your preference.

#### Task 5

1. Make sure to have the `mpg` dataset loaded by typing `data(mpg)` (and `library(ggplot2)` if you haven't!). Use the `table` function to find out how many cars were built by *mercury*? 
1. What is the average year the audi's were built in this dataset? Use the function `mean` on the subset of column `year` that corresponds to `audi`. (Be careful: subsetting a `tibble` returns a `tibble` (and not a vector)!. so get the `year` column after you have subset the `tibble`.) 
1. Use the `dplyr` piping syntax from above first with `group_by` and then with `summarise(newvar=your_expression)` to find the mean `year` by all manufacturers (i.e. same as previous task, but for all manufacturers. don't write a loop!).



## Programming Basics

### Control Flow

In `R`, the if/else syntax is:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (condition = TRUE) {
  some R code
} else {
  more R code
}
```

For example,

```{r}
x = 1
y = 3
if (x > y) {
  z = x * y
  print("x is larger than y")
} else {
  z = x + 5 * y
  print("x is less than or equal to y")
}

z
```

`R` also has a special function `ifelse()` which is very useful. It returns one of two specified values based on a conditional statement.

```{r}
ifelse(4 > 3, 1, 0)
```

**For Loops**

Now a `for` loop example,

```{r}
x = 11:15
for (i in 1:5) {
  x[i] = x[i] + i
}

x
```


### Functions

So far we have been using functions, but haven't actually discussed some of their details.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
function_name(arg1 = 10, arg2 = 20)
```

To use a function, you simply type its name, followed by an open parenthesis, then specify values of its arguments, then finish with a closing parenthesis. 

An **argument** is a variable which is used in the body of the function. Specifying the values of the arguments is essentially providing the inputs to the function.

We can also write our own functions in `R`. For example, we often like to "standardize" variables, that is, subtracting the sample mean, and dividing by the sample standard deviation.

\[
z = \frac{x - \bar{x}}{s}
\]

In `R` we would write a function to do this. When writing a function, there are three thing you must do.

- Give the function a name. Preferably something that is short, but descriptive.
- Specify the arguments using `function()`
- Write the body of the function within curly braces, `{}`.

```{r}
standardize = function(x) {
  m = mean(x)
  std = sd(x)
  result = (x - m) / std
  result
}
```

Here the name of the function is `standardize`, and the function has a single argument `x` which is used in the body of function. Note that the output of the final line of the body is what is returned by the function. In this case the function returns the vector stored in the variable `result`.

To test our function, we will take a random sample of size `n = 10` from a normal distribution with a mean of `2` and a standard deviation of `5`.

```{r}
(test_sample = rnorm(n = 10, mean = 2, sd = 5))
standardize(x = test_sample)
```

This function could be written much more succinctly, simply performing all the operations on one line and immediately returning the result, without storing any of the intermediate results.

```{r}
standardize = function(x) {
  (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
}
```

When specifying arguments, you can provide default arguments.

```{r}
power_of_num = function(num, power = 2) {
  num ^ power
}
```

Let's look at a number of ways that we could run this function to perform the operation `10^2` resulting in `100`.

```{r}
power_of_num(10)
power_of_num(10, 2)
power_of_num(num = 10, power = 2)
power_of_num(power = 2, num = 10)

```

Note that without using the argument names, the order matters. The following code will not evaluate to the same output as the previous example.

```{r}
power_of_num(2, 10)
```

Also, the following line of code would produce an error since arguments without a default value must be specified.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
power_of_num(power = 5)
```

To further illustrate a function with a default argument, we will write a function that calculates sample variance two ways.

By default, the function will calculate the unbiased estimate of $\sigma^2$, which we will call $s^2$.

\[
s^2 = \frac{1}{n - 1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x - \bar{x})^2
\]

It will also have the ability to return the biased estimate (based on maximum likelihood) which we will call $\hat{\sigma}^2$.

\[
\hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x - \bar{x})^2
\]

```{r}
get_var = function(x, biased = FALSE) {
  n = length(x) - 1 * !biased
  (1 / n) * sum((x - mean(x)) ^ 2)
}
```

```{r}
get_var(test_sample)
get_var(test_sample, biased = FALSE)
var(test_sample)
```

We see the function is working as expected, and when returning the unbiased estimate it matches `R`'s built in function `var()`. Finally, let's examine the biased estimate of $\sigma^2$.

```{r}
get_var(test_sample, biased = TRUE)
```
